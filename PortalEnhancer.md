# Portal Enhancer: Privacy Policy

Welcome to the Portal Enhancer Chrome extension!

This extension is developed by [**Mossa Jehad**](https://github.com/MossaJehad).

As an enthusiast of apps who understands the importance of privacy. Recognizing the frustration that comes with apps collecting data without your consent, I want to assure you that this extension does not gather any personally identifiable information.

All data, including student portal login information, grades/marks, or preferences such as themes, is stored locally on your browser alone. You have the control to erase this data simply by uninstalling the extension.

If you have any questions or concerns regarding your data and privacy, please send me an email at [moosa.jehad65@gmail.com](mailto:moosa.jehad65@gmail.com), and I will surely help you.
